## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1️⃣ Properly structuring HTML lists: I learned that <a> tags should go inside <li> instead of wrapping around them for valid HTML.

2️⃣ CSS hover effects: Using hover on both <li> and <a> improves the user experience.

3️⃣ Responsive design best practices: Using max-width on images prevents layout breaking on different screen sizes.

4️⃣ Accessibility improvements: Ensuring links are properly structured enhances usability for screen readers.

### Continued development

As I move forward with more projects, I want to focus on improving the following areas:

1️⃣ Accessibility (a11y) – Ensuring all interactive elements are properly structured for screen readers and keyboard navigation. I plan to research ARIA attributes and semantic HTML best practices to make my projects more inclusive.

2️⃣ Responsive Design – While I applied mobile-first principles in this project, I want to dive deeper into CSS media queries, flexbox vs. grid, and using clamp() and minmax() for better fluid layouts.

3️⃣ Reusable Components – As I transition to frameworks like React, I want to build UI components that are modular and scalable for future projects.

4️⃣ CSS Animations & Microinteractions – Adding subtle hover effects, transitions, and animations using keyframes, GSAP, or Framer Motion to enhance user experience.

5️⃣ JavaScript for Interactivity – Right now, my project is static, but in future projects, I want to use JavaScript to handle dynamic content, such as form validation, API fetching, or dark mode toggles.

6️⃣ Performance Optimization – Exploring lazy loading, image optimization, and CSS/JS minification to improve page load speeds.

### Useful resources

1️⃣ [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - My go-to resource for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides well-documented guides, examples, and references.

2️⃣ [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - Used for code reviews, debugging, and getting explanations on tricky concepts. Helped me refine my code and improve structure.
